        <p>Yaposh engine and its executors used to evaluate yaposh plan. The 
            execution of engine consists from changes of inner state of engine. 
            The engine has for each drive its own stack of executors, so if plan 
            has 5 drives, engine has 5 stacks. Each stack consists from executors, 
            in each iteration, engine will choose one stack and execute 
            the executor on its top.</p>
        <p>The executor will do perform some kind of action and returns object 
            (FireResult) that engine uses to change the state of stack, depending 
            on FireResult, engine can clear the stack, add new element on 
            the top or something else.</p>
