        <p>Classes for creation and execution of primitives. When engine want 
            to actully perform some action or get value of the sense, it askes 
            some <code>IWorkExecutor</code> to do it.</p>
        <p><code>StateWorkExecutor</code> (used by Yaposh) takes instances of 
            <code>IAction</code> and <code>ISense</code> and executes them. It 
            is not very comfortable to always implement interface, so 
            user should use one of abstract classes provided by this package:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>ParamsAction - for parametrized actions, easy to use parameters, but user has to carefuly write methods of action (reflection API is used to find methods for phases).</li>
            <li>StateAction - very basic abstract class implementing <code>IAction</code> with access to context.</li>
            <li>ParamsSense - for parametrized sense, easy to use parameters, but user has to carefuly write query method, the sense is using reflection API to find the method.</li>
            <li>StateSense - very basic abstract class implementing <code>ISense</code> with access to context.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Yaposh is using automatic instantiation of primitives from fully qualified names found in the plan. 
            Automatic instantiation requires standard constructor, thus all primitives must have public constructor with one parameter - subclass of type Context (same one as in generic parameter of <code>IAction/ISense</code>).</p>
        <p>All classes of primitives (the ones overriding IAction / ISense) should be annotated with <code>PrimitiveInfo</code>. The annotation
        provides useful information to the editor.</p>
