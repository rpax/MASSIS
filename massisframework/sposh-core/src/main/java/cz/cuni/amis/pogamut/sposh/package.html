        <p>Classes and interfaces used with behavior class. Behavior class is 
            an obsolete method of implementing primitives, i.e. actions and senses, 
            for *POSH plans. The idea is that user will create a special behavior 
            class, where some methods will be actions or senses.</p>
        <p>When engine would request to call an action, the <code>IWorkExecutor</code> would 
            take the behavior class and it would try to find a method annotated 
            with <code>@SPOSHAction</code> and that method would be called.</p>
        <p>The methods of senses would have annotation <code>@SPOSHSense</code>.</p>
        <p>This way of specifying has several problems, e.g. names of actions/senses 
            can be same as names of java methods, so action with dash like 
            <code>pick-iteam</code> are not possible.</p>
        <p>Even bigger problem is execution of actions, there is no cleanup code 
            for actions, so when another action is executed after e.g. move, it 
            has no idea if agent is actually moving or not.</p>
